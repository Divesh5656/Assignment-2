# Assignment-2

I have chosen to do a Weather condition themed website for my project because there are lack of websites providing weather information with bright and vibrant colours that will help  others to view easily. A Weather condition can have various different types of readings which is really interesting to know and learn about.

## Design Process

Some insights about my design process, focusing on my user based view, it is for the younger generation who understand better with pictures and colours to have a easy and neat read  and understanding about the weather conditions worldwide, adding a about us and contact us page is the best way to help them because it provides a convenient way for interested users to view my website while also allowing myself to expand on my skills and services as i move up. But the ultimate purpose of my website is to provide a way for me to land more clients, whether that means freelance work, more clients for my agency or employment at a company.

list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I included a section about us, so that I can get my users to get a better understanding of the website.
- As a user type, I included a section contact us, so that I can get my users to contact me if they are interested to know more.
- As a user type, I included a section weather conditions, this page is the main page for the users to use , it helps to know more about the worldwide weather conditions.
